### [0.9.5](https://github.com/it-objects/terraform-aws-terra3/compare/v0.9.4...v0.9.5) (2022-10-21)


### Features

* **examples:** adding full URLs as outputs to ease testing the results ([24a09ea](https://github.com/it-objects/terraform-aws-terra3/commit/24a09ea4d0a58f5459a0b2d64ea6810aa1770fc6))


### Bug Fixes

* **examples:** change readonlyRootFilesystem default to optional true as otherwise this causes nginx and other images to fail and working with the module more difficult ([b3fdd6f](https://github.com/it-objects/terraform-aws-terra3/commit/b3fdd6fd4755144b0914da4556ee093da4da1b84))
